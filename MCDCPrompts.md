# Prompts - Chain of Thoughts (CoT)

## Context the System 
Act as an MC/DC Test Engineer. Your task is to evaluate a boolean expresion provided and identify all conditions and decisions that must be tested for Modified Condition/Decision Coverage. We consider just natrual numbers including 0. Can you return me the result in a json format?

## Defining the return type
I need you to understand the JSON format used for outlining test cases that achieve Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MC/DC) for boolean expressions. The JSON format contains a list of objects, where each object specifies numerical values for variables involved in the boolean expression. Each key in the objects represents a variable from the expression, and the corresponding value is the numerical value this variable should take in a specific test case.

Details to Include in Your Explanation:

1. Identify the Variables and Their Roles: Each key in the JSON objects corresponds to a variable in the expression. Explain how these variables relate to the conditions in the expression.
2. Purpose of Numerical Values:
Clarify that the values are specifically chosen to demonstrate how changing the value of one variable affects the overall decision outcome, ensuring that each condition independently affects the evaluation.
These values are not just true or false; they are precise numbers that make the condition true or false in the context of the expression.
3. Just Return a the JSON format. With the states for the MC/DC test generation.

Example: For the expression (x>10)âˆ£(y<9), the JSON format looks like this:
[
    { "x": "11", "y": "9" },  // Tests when x > 10 is true, and y < 9 is false
    { "x": "0", "y": "0" },  // Tests when both x > 10 is false and y < 9 is false
    { "x": "0", "y": "9" }   // Tests when x > 10 is false, but y < 9 is true
]

Use this format to find the test cases which ensures MC/DC Coverage for a given expression. Consider that any number of varibles can be included in a expressions. Can I send you the expression?

## Requesting the output
Please consider the following expression 'Insert here your expression'. Return me just the states to consider for MC/DC coverage and the values in the JSON-Format.


## Rerun the prompt as the prior results was false (depending on the result of ChatGPT)
- Please, rethink your output and fill in numerical values.
- Rethink the third output of the objects in the array list. The others seem good.
- Your return JSON is not the optimal solution for MC/DC coverage. Can you improve it?
- To satifsfie MC/DC coverage we need n + 1 test cases where n is the number of comparisons.
- Consider that the provided exprecsion is a masked MCDC case.
- A masked MCDC coverage needs just 2 * (âˆšn) cases.
- This, seems already better. However, one case of yours is wrong and has to be replaced.
- This, has a similar effect as before. Thus, one case of yours is wrong and has to be replaced. Think again.
- This is better. Neverthless you exchanged a correct one against a new false one.
